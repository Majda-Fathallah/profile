		<h1>My journey & style 💃🏻</h1>	


		<p> I started dancing at the age of 6 and like all young girls I started with ballet, which I practiced at the conservatory. After moving to Gabon, I joined a dance school in the capital and it was there that I discovered the urban side of dance. My style took another turn at that time and I went from contemporary to "street dance". I fell in love with afrodance and reggae and today I specialise in both of these as well as reggaeton and street jazz. </p>
